4.1.1 Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

4.1.2 Where possible, remove get, list and watch access to secret objects in the cluster.

4.1.3 Where possible replace any use of wildcards in clusterroles and roles with specific
objects or actions.

4.1.4 Where possible, remove create access to pod objects in the cluster.

4.1.5 Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access
to the Kubernetes API server.
Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value
automountServiceAccountToken: false

4.1.6 Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service
account tokens to disable it.

4.2.1 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that
the .spec.privileged field is omitted or set to false.

4.2.2 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.hostPID field is omitted or set to false.

4.2.3 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.hostIPC field is omitted or set to false.

4.2.4 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.hostNetwork field is omitted or set to false.

4.2.5 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation field is omitted or set to false.

4.2.6 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.runAsUser.rule is set to either MustRunAsNonRoot or MustRunAs with the range of
UIDs not including 0.

4.2.7 Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
.spec.requiredDropCapabilities is set to include either NET_RAW or ALL.

4.2.8 Ensure that allowedCapabilities is not present in PSPs for the cluster unless
it is set to an empty array.

4.2.9 Review the use of capabilities in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace
contains applications which do not require any Linux capabities to operate consider adding
a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities.

4.4.1 Review the documentation of AWS CNI plugin, and ensure latest CNI version is used.

4.4.2 Follow the documentation and create NetworkPolicy objects as you need them.

4.5.1 If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than
from environment variables.

4.5.2 Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party
secrets management solution.

4.6.1 No remediation
4.7.1 Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need
them.

4.7.2 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a
suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker
Containers.

4.7.3 Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.

5.1.2 Azure Container Registry
If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant
permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. Currently,
the recommended configuration is to use the az aks create or az aks update command to
integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal. For
detailed steps, see Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes
Service.
To avoid needing an Owner or Azure account administrator role, you can configure a
service principal manually or use an existing service principal to authenticate ACR from
AKS. For more information, see ACR authentication with service principals or Authenticate
from Kubernetes with a pull secret.

5.2.1 Azure Active Directory integration
The security of AKS clusters can be enhanced with the integration of Azure Active Directory
(AD). Built on decades of enterprise identity management, Azure AD is a multi-tenant,
cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory
services, application access management, and identity protection. With Azure AD, you can
integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account
management and security.
Azure Active Directory integration with AKS clusters
With Azure AD-integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes
resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a kubectl configuration
context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command. When a user then interacts
with the AKS cluster with kubectl, they're prompted to sign in with their Azure AD
credentials. This approach provides a single source for user account management and
password credentials. The user can only access the resources as defined by the cluster
administrator.
Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect
is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID
Connect, see the Open ID connect documentation. From inside of the Kubernetes cluster,
Webhook Token Authentication is used to verify authentication tokens. Webhook token
authentication is configured and managed as part of the AKS cluster.
